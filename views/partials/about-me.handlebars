			<p>My name is James Cowart. I studied electrical engineering at Auburn University and earned my certification in Full Stack Web Development at the Georgia Institute of Technology. For the past six years, I have worked as a Lead Web Developer for Big Picture Digital in Atlanta, GA. My proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Wordpress have excelled in this position. Through my studies at Georgia Tech, I was able to pursue my interests in back-end software and logic, a passion that originated from my deep-seated love of mathematics and algorithmic problem-solving.</p>
			<p>Looking forward, I plan to bring my server-side and client-side expertise to a position as a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
